For our tenth episode, we sat down with the wonderful people of Alzabo Soup and talked about one of the most beloved and pioneering, yet highly contentious, authors from the past century: **Gene Wolfe**.

This month's questions are:   

1. When is it acceptable to cry at a bus stop?
2. How often is a wolf the key to a Gene Wolfe book?
3. How many groups of fans can Phil and Metz alienate in one single podcast?
4. Does it take longer to hear us talk about "The Toy Theatre" than to actually read it?
5. Is everyone gay with everyone else?

Find out all of these answers and more in this month's episode!
