This month's questions are:   

1.  Is Celine Dione due a crazy comeback?
2.  Should all romantic comedies be told from the perspective of the man as plain as toast?
3.  To what degree is it inappropriate is it to ask to see someone's nipple piercing?
4.  How many subplots is too many subplots?

Find out all of these answers and more in this month's episode!
