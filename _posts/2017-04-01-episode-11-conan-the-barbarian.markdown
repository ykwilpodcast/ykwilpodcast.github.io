This month we sat down and talked about the character who's name has become ubiquitous with both melancholy and mirth: **Conan the Barbarian**.

This month's questions are:   

1. How many platitudes are too many platitudes?
2. Who's Dad is the cutest of them all?
3. What is the least appropriate moment in which to receive a prophecy?
4. Would Mark and Sophie punch a camel?
5. Are there any redeeming parts of the 2011 remake of Conan the Barbarian (other than Jason Mamoa's beautiful face)?

Find out all of these answers and more in this month's episode!
