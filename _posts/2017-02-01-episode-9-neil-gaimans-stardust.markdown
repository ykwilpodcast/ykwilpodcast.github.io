For our ninth episode, we sat down and talked about the subversive, bizarre and insanely charming fantasy adventure through the wonderful world of Stormhold: **Neil Gaiman's Stardust**.

This month's questions are:   

1. Is Neil Gaiman's "Stardust" the epitome of a good adaptation?
2. Should Michelle Pfeiffer have transformed into a gigantic winged beast?
3. Is this film worthy of our longest "Fashion Watch" yet?
4. Do you think that Sophie has a future career as a Scottish Widow?
5. How do we feel about goats?


Find out all of these answers and more in this month's episode!
