This month's questions are:   

1.  What remains consistent over such a long spanning franchise?
2.  Why should they make a Final Fantasy farming simulator?
3.  Does Mark manage to dodge answering Sophie's question about what his favourite Final Fantasy game is?

Find out all of these answers and more in this month's episode!
