For our second episode, we sat down and talked about one of the most prominent horror games that exists across all consoles: **Resident Evil** in all of its forms: both its original source material and the films that they inspired.

This month's questions are:   

1.  Which is the best way to crossover all of the Resident Evil movies with the TV show *Friends*?
2.  Why did the Executioners almost make Mark cry with joy?
3.  Will Sophie ever sit down and play a Resident Evil game?

Find out all of these answers and more in this month's episode!
