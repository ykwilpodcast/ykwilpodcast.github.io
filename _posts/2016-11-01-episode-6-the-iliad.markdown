*Do you get overly attached to things without any real explanation of why? Then this is the podcast for you. **You Know What I Like...?** is a regularly scheduled enthusiastic flailing about another piece of pop culture.*

*For our sixth episode, we sat down and talked about potentially the oldest and most influential piece of literature to have ever existed: **The Iliad**. However, as that isn't the most accessible of topics, we're looking at it through the 2004 movie: **Troy**.*

This month's questions are:

2. What music would best fit as the soundtrack of a spoken-word version of The Iliad?
3. Does Mark share too much information about his sexual awakening?

Find out all of these answers and more in this month's episode!
