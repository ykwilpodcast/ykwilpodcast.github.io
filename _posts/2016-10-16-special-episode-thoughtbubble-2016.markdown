*Do you get overly attached to things without any real explanation of why? Then this is the podcast for you. **You Know What I Like...?** is a regularly scheduled enthusiastic flailing about another piece of pop culture.*

For our first special episode, we sat down and talked about one of the biggest and most well attended indie comic festivals in the United Kingdom: **Thought Bubble**.

  3. What is Sophie going to be throwing herself at both literally and metaphorically?
Find out all of these answers and more in this month's episode!
