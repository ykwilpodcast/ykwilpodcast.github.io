Do you get overly attached to things without any real explanation of why? Then this is the podcast for you. You Know What I Like...? is a regularly scheduled enthusiastic flailing about another piece of pop culture.

For our first special episode, we sat down and talked about one of the biggest and most well attended indie comic festivals in the United Kingdom: Thought Bubble. We were joined by such a broad range of magnificent guests, all of whom were kind enough to give us their time.

On to the subject at hand! What makes Thought Bubble stand above the rest as a comic festival? Who are our guests most looking forward to accidentally-on-purpose running into? What is Sophie going to be throwing herself at both literally and metaphorically? Find out all of these answers and more in this month's episode!
