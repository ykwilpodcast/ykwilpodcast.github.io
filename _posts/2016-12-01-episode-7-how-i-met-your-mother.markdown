For our seventh episode,  we sat down and talked about the comedy series that dragged on far longer than anyone expected: **How I Met Your Mother**.

This month's questions are:   

1. Who are our favourite ships out of all of the ships?
2. How many tears do we shed every time Alyson Hannigan makes a sad face?
3. Could your survive this episode's drinking game?
+ Drink every time Sophie calls someone a babe
+ Drink every time Mark and Sophie talk about something that isn't *How I Met Your Mother*

Find out all of these answers and more in this month's episode!
