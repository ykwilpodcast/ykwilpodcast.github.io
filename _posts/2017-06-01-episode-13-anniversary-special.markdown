This month we sat down and talked about *You Know What I Like...?* celebrating its one year anniversary. To celebrate, we reminisce about everything that we've done so far and then decided to discuss all of those little topics that we couldn't find a place for during the year.

We also had a very special visit from the wonderful Megan Conway from Valley Arts Theatre Company to give us a very fascinating insight into stage production. Go and follow [Valley Arts Theatre Company on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ValleyArtsYork) for all of the news about their upcoming productions.

The topics that we covered include:
1. How Terrible We Used To Be (Or How Much We've Grown)
2. Neuschwanstein Castle
3. Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (and its novelisation)
4. Why Mark is Trash For Buying The "Resident Evil: The Final Chapter" Novelisation
5. Desperate Romantics
6. Problematic Favourites
7. Ordinary Days
8. Valley Arts Theatre Company
