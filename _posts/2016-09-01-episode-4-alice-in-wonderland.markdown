For our fourth episode, we sat down and talked about one of the most culturally influential pieces of prose: **Alice in Wonderland**.

This month's questions are:   

1.  Is there a method to the madness of Wonderland?
2.  Is every story simply telling the story of a parallel world?
3.  How would we create a sequel to Through the Looking Glass?

Find out all of these answers and more in this month's episode!
