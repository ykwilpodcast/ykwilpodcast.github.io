For our eighth episode, we sat down and talked about the most engaging, progressive and downright exciting franchises that has seen a significant resurgance since the 1980s: **Jem and the Holograms**.

This month's questions are:   

1. What futuristic show is Sophie thinking of from her childhood that she mistook for Jem and the Holograms?
2. Does Mark have a future career in marketing and advertising?
3. Is Rama the Llama due a comeback?
4. Could Mark and Sophie defend any trashy Hollywood movie?
